    "## 6. Stop Word Removal\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:** Removes common words that contribute little semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When needed:** Text classification, information retrieval, feature reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common stop words:** the, is, a, an, and, or, but, in, at, to, for, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Reduces feature dimensionality\n",
    "- Improves model focus on meaningful words\n",

    "- running, runs → run\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Fast computation\n",
    "- Reduces vocabulary size\n",
    "- Groups related words\n",
    "\n",

    "**When needed:** When you need valid English words, semantic understanding important.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How:** Uses morphological analysis and vocabularies (spaCy, NLTK).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- walking, walks, walked → walk\n",
    "- am, are, is → be (context-aware!)\n",

    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Produces valid English words\n",
    "- Better preserves semantic meaning\n",
